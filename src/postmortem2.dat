Part 1:

Overview:
	I intended to create an Auction House for the video game, Path of Exile. An Auction House, in many other games, allows users to list items and allows other users to bid on those items in order to win the auction, and the item. Path of Exile does not have such a feature, so I decided to create my own. I am fairly certain that, were I to take my project live, my implementation would be against the game’s terms of service. Furthermore, based on my knowledge of the game community, a significant portion of the player base would refuse to use it on principle. However, I was interested in this project more of a proof of concept then actually hosting and maintaining it.

Reflection: 
	I think that the goal of the term project was to test the student’s knowledge of the concepts taught in the class, along with the ability to research and think outside of the box (we certainly did not have all of the information needed to create the project, but we had a strong basis).

	My main goal on this project was to get a better understanding of PHP. The CSS that I used was fairly simple (many of the homeworks/quizzes were harder). My Javascript was also pretty simple, but I already had quite a bit of experience with Javascript. I also had pretty good knowledge of databases. So, all that is left is learning PHP. I would say that I accomplished my goal fairly well.

	When I finally shut of the VM (after simply saving the state for the entire project), it reported that I had had it open for 28 hours. I think that a good lower bound for the amount of time I spent was 14 hours. So it was realistically somewhere between 14 and 28, probably closer to 14.

	I successfully implemented login/register, the ability to post a listing, the ability to bid on a listing, the ability to buy out a listing, the ability to save notes for a listing, and the ability to search through listings. For each of these things, I feel like I did a particularly good job with the security. Every field that was submitted was validated in some way or another. 

	I’m not really sure about this category. I don’t that that the aesthetics of my site are spectacular. Particularly, I thought that I would have the time to create a better logo. However, I decided to spend more time on the back-end since working on my PHP skills are more important, and the logo seemed good enough. 

	Furthermore, I believe that in my initial project outline I stated that I would be supporting every Gem in Path of Exile on my site. However, retrieving the names and image files for over 100 gems turned out to be pretty tedious, unsurprisingly, so I cut that number down to six.

	Biggest challenges:
1. Getting the dates to work properly in PHP. I spent an embarrassingly long time floundering with PHP’s Datetime class until I figured out that it would just be easier to use timestamps and add minutes/hours manually.
2. Positioning in CSS. Nearly half of my time was spent entirely on front end, and most of that on CSS positioning. To be brutally honest, I probably would have had a less stressful time had I not tried to be such a perfectionist in the beginning. I would be willing to take a few points off for those hours of my life back.

	Apart from the above, everything in PHP was pretty smooth sailing. Granted, PHP is pretty irritating to work with sometimes, but I did not hit any major roadblocks.

	To answer the final two questions, I would say that nothing really went wrong, but if I were given an extra two weeks to work on the project, I would spend that time improving the aesthetics. If I were to do this project over again, I would try to squeeze that extra two weeks in, somehow. 

Assessment:
	I believe that this project deserves a 95. I do not feel like it is particularly stunning, visually. However, everything works as it is intended to work. I feel as if the homeworks and quizzes in this class sufficiently tested our ability to use CSS, so 5 points off for less than perfect visuals is fair. 



Course:

Reflection:
	I think that the main course goal was to learn about HTML, CSS, and PHP. I think I achieved that pretty well. I did not have much a background in these topics in particular (though I had worked with other PHP-esque frameworks before).

	My personal goal was to learn about CSS, as it was the biggest enigma to me coming into this class. I would say I did not achieve this goal completely, but I now know enough CSS to do a reasonable job working with it.

	My biggest challenge was managing the time that I spent on this course versus the time that I spent on other courses. All of the other challenges I faced stemmed from this one, as they could have been easily solved given more time. Personally, I feel like I handled this challenge well; I chose in favor of my IPPD course, mostly, as it was more important to me that I impress my sponsor company than that I impress the teacher of this course. 

	The quizzes and homeworks that were very applied went well. I think the project went pretty well too.
	
	As for what went wrong, I did not do very well on the quizzes that required a lot of memorization. Nor did I do very well on the subjective homeworks. For instance, I scored particularly low on the homework which required us to find well-designed websites and explain why.

	If I had to do it over again, I would have worked harder over Spring Break and scored higher on my lowest assignment. Also, I would have studied more efficiently for the quizzes. Overall, I am happy with my performance in the course, but I am less happy with my current grade, so I would try to bring that up in any way possible.

Assessment:
	I would give myself a B in this class. If you count all of the points directly, I am fairly close to a B, assuming that I graded myself properly on the project. The quizzes were my poorest area. I don’t think that the quizzes were unfair, but I did not like the fact that they were feast or famine for me. I studied for all of them equally, but I did exceedingly well on some, and outright failed others. So, I think that it is pretty clear by looking at my quiz grades that I am competent and that I understand the material, and simply have weak points here and there. I didn’t do “A” work, but I did “B” work.

Moving forwards:
	1. I learned that I never want to use PHP again.
	2. I learned that I did not know as much as I thought about web applications.

	I would tell future students of this class to study for the quizzes, and to start the project before the details are announced (a generic front end could easily be developed).

Course content:

	I’ll answer the first few questions very briefly.

	1. 65%
	2. 5%
	3. 0%
	4. 100%
	5. 5%
	6. 100%
	7. 85%

	I think that the subject material was pretty good, but you can do some crazy awesome things with javascript so more time should be spent on that, especially so people can use it in their projects. I think that the content was appropriate in general, but most people I talked to think we spent too much time on CSS. 

	Personally, I have no interest in the color/design theory aspect. I think that if I ever have a great idea for a web application, I will pay someone else to do it. However, I think it is an important topic for this course. Maybe there is a way to teach it without stressing it so much in the assignments.

	I don’t really know what could be added. Javascript should be expanded upon more, but that’s basically all I see.

	I think that the PHP was fine. Javascript is kind of a crazy language so maybe a bit more time could have been spent on syntax. However, if more time could be spent covering popular javascript libraries, like jQuery, that would be worth not spending much time on the javascript syntax.

	Discussing pre-written code was better for me. However, I did not tend to pay as much attention with the pre-written code, as it only required me to look up every so often to see what was going on. So, both methods have their merits.

	I think I’ve already been verbose enough about how to make the course better, but I will stress one more time that less CSS and more javascript would be nice.
